# Physics Engine

I'm building a 3D physics engine in C++ from scratch. The goal is to understand the math and logic behind physical simulations by implementing them myself.

## Getting Started

You'll need CMake and a C++ compiler to build this. I'm using GLFW for window management and OpenGL for rendering.

### Build Instructions

1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
3.  Run CMake: `cd build && cmake ..`
4.  Build: `cmake --build .`

## Current Status

Right now, I've just got a basic window opening up. It's not much, but it's the foundation I need to start drawing things.
